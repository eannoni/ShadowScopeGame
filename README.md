HOW TO PLAY:

Welcome to ShadowScope! Your goal is to eliminate players on the enemy team until your team wins. Try not to get killed and get the enemy team closer to winning!

You can set your nickname in the main menu and to get into a game, you can either create and host a room yourself or join one that another player has created. In these rooms, you can also click to join your preferred team. Once the host is ready, they can click “Start game” and you’ll load into the game.

You’ll spawn in a random area and are then free to move and shoot as you like! Keep in mind that you have a limited amount of health and ammo, but you can find health and ammo pickups around the map. Additionally, you have a light on your scope to make it easier for you to be seen by other players.

Lastly, the game ends when one team reaches the required amount of kills. Have fun!

Controls:

WASD or arrow keys to move left, right, up, and down.
Space or left-click to shoot.
Shift to crouch and increase your field of vision.
Mouse position to aim

TODO:
Quit Game button/return to lobby at end of game (We tried for many hours using many online resources but none of them worked without causing significant bugs, so we weren’t able to get this to work).
